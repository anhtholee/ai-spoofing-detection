# AI Spoofing Detection Project 
(*Generated by Gemini*)

This project focuses on building a system to detect GPS spoofing using a combination of rule-based heuristics and machine learning models. It includes components for data generation, model training and evaluation, and AI-powered explanations for flagged events.

## Key Features:

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creates realistic and spoofed location event data for training and testing.
- **Rule-Based Baseline:** Implements a set of heuristics to identify obvious spoofing patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trains a Random Forest Classifier to detect more subtle spoofing behaviors.
- **AI Explanations:** Utilizes a Large Language Model (Gemini Pro) to provide human-readable explanations for why certain events are flagged as spoofed.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Includes a Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis of model performance, PR curves, and error analysis.

## Project Structure:

- `submission/data/`: Generated training and testing datasets.
- `submission/src/`: All Python source code for data generation, model training, rules, and AI explanations.
- `submission/eval_report.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for project evaluation and analysis.
- `submission/*.csv`, `submission/*.json`: Output files containing predictions and AI explanations.
